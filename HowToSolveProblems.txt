1) Listen to the problem
2) Repeat the problem as you understand it 
3) Clarify the problem with questions
4) Walk through 2-3 examples
5) Determine edge cases
6) Ask if optimizing for time or space complexity
7) Determine a brute-force solution and its runtime
8) Optimize the brute force solution
9) Walkthrough best solution you can think of in detail. Do not start coding 
   until you understand each detail
10) Implement your solution while focusing on good code, abstracting away 
    things that are not the focus of the problem
11) Scan code line-by-line for compilation bugs
12) Test multiple small cases, then edge cases
13) Discuss how your solution(s) scale with larger input
